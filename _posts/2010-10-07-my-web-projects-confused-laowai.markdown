Apart from <a href="http://niel.delarouviere.com/tag/social-mandarin/">Social Mandarin</a>, I've got another Chinese project called <a href="http://confusedlaowai.com">Confused Laowai</a>. Laowai is a term for a foreigner in China. I started this personal blog in January 2010 as a way to post about my progress as I go through my studies in Mandarin and my Mandarin journey. Confused Laowai has been a very interesting project experience.
<h3>Response</h3>
To me, Confused Laowai, is the closest I've come to a proper blog/reader relationship. Yes, <a href="http://niel.delarouviere.com/tag/twindie-net/">Twindie.net</a> has more readers and more hits, but Confused Laowai has more engagement. I feel like I have a proper community that follows my blog. This has been really good.
<h3>Growth</h3>
The blog has grown slowly in the start. I posted comments on numerous similar blogs by Mandarin learners and created a <a href="http://twitter.com/confusedlaowai">Twitter account</a> that focuses on my Mandarin learning missions. I have also posted most of my blog posts on <a href="http://socialmandarin.com">Social Mandarin</a> and have posted one or two posts on <a href="http://haohaoreport.com">Hao Hao Report</a> which got me nice hits and readers in the process.
<h3>The Future</h3>
As long as I study Mandarin, this blog will be alive. Which will probably be quite a long time. It will only grow and I feel that I can create an even better blog/reader relationship, learning a lot in the process. I intend to do a bit more video blog posts too. It has gained PR2 in a very short while and is getting hits from Google from a wide range of search terms, probably the most of all my web projects. It doesn't get the most search hits, but definitely the widest!
