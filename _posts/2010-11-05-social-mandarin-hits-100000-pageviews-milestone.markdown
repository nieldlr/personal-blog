According the Awstats (yeah, I know not the best measure of pageviews), <a href="http://socialmandarin.com">Social Mandarin</a> has hit 100, 000 total pageviews yesterday. The site started in March this year and has slowly been picking up traffic. It still does not have a pagerank, which I'm eagerly waiting for as the site really needs some more outside interest. There was a recent surge of interest and traffic when I finally decided to post it some relevant <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> subsections. Some tips were given on how to improve the site and these will definitely be implemented.

In other news, <a href="http://shotbeak.com">Simon</a> and I also reached a milestone in Google Adsense. Our first cheque will be on its way very soon. :)
