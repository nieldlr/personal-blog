In my spare time, I sometimes dabble in writing songs. I have been writing music since primary school. Of course it sucked back then. Lately, I'm a lot into electronic music production. Mostly because it doesn't need a big studio setup, which I can't afford at present. I can make music club-filling music in the comfort of my little study. I seldom finish tunes, mostly because I get frustrated with progression, or I get hit by a perfection bias. However, when I finish them, I think they're quite nifty.

A current project is called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rouviere/125913424125541">Rouviere</a>. This is purely an electronic music project at the moment. Mostly dance genres, ranging from dubstep to electro house. However, Rouviere, is an umbrella project for music <a href="http://simondlr.com">Simon</a> (my twin brother) and I create. Sometimes, I do a whole song on my own. Other times we collab together. It's mainly just a release for electronic music that doesn't have a place for its own.

I just finished a song a few weeks ago. Have a listen!
